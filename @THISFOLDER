~/projects/(project)/

This is the project development root directory. 

This folder name is the Geany project name 
 but not the Geany project base path. 

All (major) folders within this one also contain a similar file, @THISFOLDER. 
Unlike a README file this describes only the folder role and structure; 
 not its specific contents. 

In these descriptions, parentheses represent project-specific substitutions: 

	(project)				The project under development
	(Project::Module)		A Perl module developed for (project)
	(Module.pm)				The file implementing (Project::Module)
	(Project)				Namespace (folder) of (Module.pm)
	
	* Naturally, (Project) need not be the Title Case of (project). 
	  If a module under development looks to be of more general use, 
	   its namespace should be reconsidered. 

It is essential that all symlinks here be *relative*.
