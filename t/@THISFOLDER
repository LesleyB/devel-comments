~/projects/(project)/t/

This is the project test script directory. 

Files in this path are project-specific *.t files only. 

Actual test scripts are kept in t/all/. 
Symlinks to test scripts that are to ship 
    with the project distribution are kept in t/go/. 
Additional folders may contain symlinks to test scripts; 
    these additional folders are for the purpose of categorization/tagging.

See also @THISFOLDER in each child folder.
