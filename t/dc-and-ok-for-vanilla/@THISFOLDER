~/projects/(project)/t/dc-and-ok-for-vanilla/

Contains symlinks to actual test scripts in t/all/.

These scripts are written by Xiong using the 'test-humpish box' style: 
    Test::More 0.94;
    Test::Deep;
    Try::Tiny;

    IO::Capture::Stdout::Extended;
    IO::Capture::Stderr::Extended;
    IO::Capture::Sayfix;
    IO::Capture::Tellfix;

They exercise D::C but do not exercise any new features; 
    so they may be converted to use vanilla S::C instead.
