Contains symlinks to actual test scripts in t/all/.

These scripts are written by Xiong using the 'test-humpish box' style: 
    Test::More 0.94;
    Test::Deep;
    Try::Tiny;

    IO::Capture::Stdout::Extended;
    IO::Capture::Stderr::Extended;
    IO::Capture::Sayfix;
    IO::Capture::Tellfix;

They exercise features new in D::C; 
    so they may *not* be converted to use vanilla S::C instead.
