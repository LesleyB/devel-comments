~/projects/(project)/t/vanilla-style-on-dc/

Contains symlinks to actual test scripts in t/all/.

These scripts were copied from the vanilla S::C distribution
    and converted by hand to run on D::C. 

These are the guarantee of strict compatibility and should not be modified. 
They have only, so far, been modified to the minimum extent consistent with 
    the need to run D::C. 

These scripts may be removed from distribution starting in v2.0.0.
