~/projects/(project)/t/should-go/

Contains symlinks to actual test scripts in t/all/.

These scripts *should* all ship with the project distribution. 
They do, but only in t/all/, which does not run when the module is "built". 

The reason is that the testing paradigm used in some of these tests is unsuitable for perl 5.008 and maybe anything less than 5.010. 

For that matter, the testing paradigm ("test-hump-ish") is probably altogether wrong and will be updated to a real Test::Ranger approach.
