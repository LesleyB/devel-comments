[james2vegas] [Xiong], have you considered making Devel::Comments an actual DB subclass, making use of the DB hooks and letting -d:Comments work?

[james2vegas] f.e. [ http://search.cpan.org/dist/Devel-NYTProf |Devel-NYTProf] uses it

[james2vegas] seems to me that those hooks might be worthwhile in your project

[james2vegas] as i said, hooks for stepping through code, examining state, that kind of thing seems a good match for your project, no need to be interactive

[bart] Xiong IMHO a debugger is not the Nirvana for debugging. Some programs just take far too many steps to get through, so singlestepping is impractical (even if some steps are combined)

[mr_mischief] If I want single-stepping, I generally want "run full speed until I tell you" or "run full speed until this sub is first called" then single-step for a while, then full-speed.

[bart] An approach that might be usable is that taken by Schlomi Fish in his module on CPAN (forgot the name) which uses the Perl debugger mechanism to attach code to any code line you like

[bart] that way you can attach log generating lines to code without hardcoding them in your source

[james2vegas] yeah, [Xiong] read [ http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DB |DB] and [ http://www.google.com/search?q=perldebguts%20site%3Aperldoc.perl.org |perldebguts]

[mr_mischief] For everything else, I print, dump, harness, or whatever I can do to avoid the debugger. single-stepping a whole program (other than a golf or short intentional obfu) is too much pain/benefit for me.

[james2vegas] yeah, what [bart] is saying

[bart] [ http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Devel%3A%3ALineTrace |Devel::LineTrace]

[Xiong] [bart] If I follow you, then you want smart comments that aren't even comments??

[bart] yeah, the debugger is only usable (IMHO) fopr short snippets, or when, in a big program, you know exactly *where* to look.

[mr_mischief] Right, [bart], and IME using prints to bisect the suspected areas until I've found where to apply the debugger works out pretty well.
 That is, if I haven't already found and solved my problem in the searching before applying the debugger at all.
