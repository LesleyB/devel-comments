Please read this file if you are a project developer. 
Development is open to anyone with an interest. 

See also: README, WORKFLOW, VERSIONS. 
You may also want to have a look at all files in /notes. 

= Conventions =

* 4 columns per indent; no hard tabs
* 78 columns per line max
* line endings: LF (*nix-ish)
* K&R bracketing and indentation; uncuddled elses
* /notes files are generally set to word-wrap
* block comments introduce all subroutines and sections (see /notes/scrap)
* please don't be clever

= Guidelines =

This project is based on Smart::Comments ('Vanilla') by Damian Conway. 
In a similar spirit, this is intended as a lightweight debugging tool. 
Please avoid loading modules. 
Only core modules are allowed. 

Vanilla requires perl version >= 5.008; let's try to stick with that. 
use feature 'say' is only for development. 

= Folders =

Please use the word 'folder' in docs. It is exactly equivalent (under *nix) 
    to 'directory' and is shorter as well. In code, 'dir' is acceptable. 

Each folder contains a file, '@THISFOLDER', which defines its contents and role.
Please do not create any new, tracked top-level folders.

Here is a summary of the folder structure: 

/file           support, data, config, log, graphic, binary files
                    Please develop graphics files in an untracked folder
                        and reserve /file for finished tasks. 

/lib            Perl modules
/notes          developer notes; you may add to these
                    Changes to this folder are propagated among branches.

/bin            executable Perl scripts
                    Any end-user project script goes here. (none planned)
/demo           project demonstrations, safe for end user to run

/t              do not put any files here -- only folders
    /all        put all actual test scripts here
    /go         symlinks to shippable test scripts
    /(?)        group of test script symlinks, by some characteristic
    /00         loading tests    
    /not-t      tests not ready for testing -- failed testing attempts
    /regress    D::C tests converted to load vanilla Smart::Comments instead

/util       utility scripts for development; beware

Please see '@THISFOLDER' for each folder for more info.
