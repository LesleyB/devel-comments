If you would like to use the git-flow tool, you can easily set up your custom branch naming as follows:

$ git config gitflow.branch.master final
$ git config gitflow.branch.develop master


Installing: 

$ git clone git://github.com/nvie/gitflow.git
$ cd gitflow
$ git submodule update --init
$ mkdir ~/projects/myproject
$ git flow init
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/xiong/projects/myproject/.git/
No branches exist yet. Base branches must be created now.
Branch name for production releases: [master] trunk
Branch name for "next release" development: [develop] 

How to name your supporting branch prefixes?
Feature branches? [feature/] 
Release branches? [release/] 
Hotfix branches? [hotfix/] 
Support branches? [support/] 
Version tag prefix? [] v
