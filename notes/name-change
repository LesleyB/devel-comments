Today, I'm changing the project name: 
    from the working title of   Smart::Comments::Any
    to the consensus choice,    Devel::Comments

The local project folder:
    formerly    ~/projects/smartlog
    to          ~/projects/comments

The GitHub repo: 
    from        http://github.com/Xiong/smart-comments-log
    to          http://github.com/Xiong/devel-comments

I'm not sure what has to change; I just know it's a lot. 
Anything previous to today's date is suspect.
