Devel::Comments is a development tool, a fork of Smart::Comments, which filters specially-formatted comments into executable code. Immediately, it extends its parent's abilities by permitting smart output to be directed to a filehandle other than STDERR. Next release also accepts a filename for output. 

Potential users of this tool have requested other features: ability to invoke an object's own method to dump; execution of arbitrary code; numerical level enabling; and invocation as a debugging module from the command line using 'perl -d:Comments', with additional options. These features exceed theoriginal Smart::Comments concept and comprise a significant departure. 

RT bugs against the original will be fixed in Devel::Comments. Now, this module is a drop-in replacement for Smart::Comments; but this may eventually change as the cost of maintaining compatibility escalates. 

Consensus on PerlMonks favors 'Devel::Comments'. Discussion at modules@cpan.org favors release as a new version of Smart::Comments but 'Devel::Comments', the name, is recommended by primary maintainer and author DCONWAY. Current maintainer, CHORNY, does not respond. Therefore this approach is closed short of hostile takeover. No particular name of the form 'Smart::Comments::*' meets with general approval. 

Devel::Comments draws a clear, unambiguous line between production code and debugging code. This may be dull to the developer who favors an interactive debugger; but it appeals to the developer who prefers to scatter print() statements around places of interest. All smart comments are disabled at once by commenting out the 'use Devel::Comments' line; the disabling is guaranteed as all such debugging code reverts to ordinary dumb comments. These can be left in production and re-enabled in the next development cycle; or permanently removed with any comment stripper.
